# Metro_Path

The objective of project "METRO PATH" is to help the people in finding the shortest path between two desired metro stations using Dijkstra's algorithm which involves simplifying the metro network by representing it as a graph with nodes and edges. The nodes represent the metro stations and the edges represent the connections between them. works by starting at the source node and exploring the neighboring nodes, assigning tentative distances and updating them as it finds shorter paths  continues until it has visited all nodes

## Data Structures Used: 
#### GRAPH: 
A graph is a common data structure used for representing networks.
#### MAP: 
A map data structure is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.
#### VECTOR: 
A vector is a data structure that represents an ordered collection of elements, more dynamic than array
